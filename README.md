A super simple one table CRUD example with Spring Data JPA and Vaadin. Uses Spring Boot for easier setup and development. Helps you to get started with basic JPA backed applications and [vaadin4spring](https://github.com/peholmst/vaadin4spring) integration library.

For larger applications, consider applying some commonly known design patterns for your UI code. Check e.g. [this MVP example](https://github.com/peholmst/vaadin4spring/tree/master/spring-vaadin-mvp).
